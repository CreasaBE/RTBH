# RTBH

a RTBH config consisting of fail2ban, bird, quagga, junos, ios and possibly mikrotik configuration scripts

---
Please note this is still under construction at this moment. Everything is still being populated and tested

Remarks and/or comments are always welcome, but please keep it civil
***

All configs and scripts are made with bits of code found from other users.
I cannot and will not take full credit for the configs in this repo

However, everything was checked and built to create a working Remotely Triggered BlackHole

This project was made with the following pieces of software:

[BIRD](http://bird.network.cz/)

[Quagga](http://www.nongnu.org/quagga/)

[Fail2Ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)
